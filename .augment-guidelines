## Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-component`)
2. Make changes in your branch
3. Submit a pull request to `main`
4. Get code reviewed and approved
5. Merge the pull request
6. Delete the feature branch

## Issue Management
- Create issues using templates from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory
- Available templates:
  - Bug report
  - Feature request
  - Custom issue

## Branching Strategy
- Branch naming convention: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`, or `support/` followed by a descriptive name
- Always branch from `main`

## Commit Guidelines
- Follow conventional commits format:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
  - `test`: Adding or updating tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Pull Request Process
- Reference related issues in the PR description
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation if necessary
- Get at least one approval before merging
